     * Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D
     * and M.
     * 
     * Symbol Value
     * I 1
     * V 5
     * X 10
     * L 50
     * C 100
     * D 500
     * M 1000
     * For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added
     * together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is
     * written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
     * 
     * Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
     * However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is
     * written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
     * The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There
     * are six instances where subtraction is used:
     * 
     * I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
     * X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
     * C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
     * Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * 
     * Input: s = "III"
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: III = 3.
     * Example 2:
     * 
     * Input: s = "LVIII"
     * Output: 58
     * Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
     * Example 3:
     * 
     * Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
     * Output: 1994
     * Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
